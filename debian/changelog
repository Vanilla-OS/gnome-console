  * d/control: transfer package to the Debian GNOME team.
    This is now a core GNOME package, maintaining it within the GNOME team
    makes more sense.
  * d/control: update minimum glib version.
    Upstream now requires glib >= 2.72, let's reflect that.
  * d/patches: rebase on latest upstream version.

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Remove constraints unnecessary since buster (oldstable)
    * Build-Depends: Drop versioned constraint on gsettings-desktop-schemas-dev
      and libpcre2-dev.
    * gnome-console: Drop versioned constraint on gsettings-desktop-schemas in
      Depends.

    No other change needed, take this opportunity to sort build-deps.
  * d/gbp.conf: set `multimaint-merge` to true

gnome-console (42~beta-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian: rename package to gnome-console.
    Upstream package became a GNOME core application and got renamed to
    `Console` in the process. This commit acknowledges this move by:
    - renaming the Debian package to `gnome-console`
    - replacing all occurrences of "Kings Cross" with "Console"
    - pointing to the new upstream URL
    - adding a transitional package for smooth upgrades
    - update copyright entries for renamed files
  * d/patches: drop obsolete patch.
    Upstream doesn't build a shared library anymore, making our patch
    obsolete as it solved a reproducibility issue affecting this exact
    shared library.
  * d/rules: drop pkg.kgx.generic build profile.
    Upstream used to provide a "generic" build profile with a different icon
    and application name than what was used for "regular" builds. This is no
    longer an option, and as such we can drop our corresponding
    `pkg.kgx.generic` build profile.
  * d/control: update build dependencies.
    Upstream bumped the required versions for some of the build
    dependencies, this commit makes sure our package has the same
    requirements.
  * debian: fix handling pre-release version numbers.
    Upstream releases beta versions with a `.beta` suffix (and similar
    suffixes are likely to be expected for alpha and rc versions). This
    commit adds the necessary bits to both our `watch` and `gbp.conf` files
    in order to properly deal with such version numbers in conformity with
    the Debian policy.
  * debian: build Nautilus extension.
    Console provides an optional extension for Nautilus. In order to build
    it and package it as `nautilus-extension-gnome-console`, this commit
    adds the necessary build-dependency and new package definition to
    `d/control`, and also introduces the corresponding `.install` file.
  * d/patches: drop custom RPATH in executable.
    Fixes: lintian: custom-library-search-path
  * d/copyright: update and add entry for `po` files.
    Our `copyright` file was missing information about translation files,
    for which translators weren't credited. Fix this and update copyright
    file so the data is accurate and includes newly added files.

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * Don't run build tests through xvfb
  * debian/rules: Don't manually set build directory
  * Don't Build-Depend on git
  * Update Vcs fields
  * debian/rules: Enable auto features.
    This force enables all the auto meson options.
    Otherwise, we could accidentally have features disabled
    because we didn't have a dependency installed.
